                <div className="about">
                    <p className="about-text">I am an Edinburgh based junior software developer who has recently completed the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. After achieving a design degree I worked in administration before making the move into software development, however my time in these roles has enabled me to develop strong interpersonal and organisational skills. A passionate problem solver with natural creativity, I love the sense of achievement that comes from seeing my solutions come to life on the screen in front of me. I am excited to combine my previous skills with my new technical skills in a role that will enable me to embrace new challenges, further learning and self-development. In my free time I love to be outdoors, and to run in the hills around Edinburgh.
